\chapter*{Preface}
\label{cha:Preface}

This manual describes the implementation details of Flick, the Flexible \IDL{}
Compiler Kit.  People interested in studying, modifying, or extending Flick
should consult this manual as a starting point.  Those who simply want to
\emph{use} Flick do not need to read this document: use of the Flick compiler
tools is described in a separate user's manual.

% \emph{Flick is always changing, so this manual will always be slightly out of
% date.}
