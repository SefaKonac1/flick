This chapter illustrates the use of Flick for implementing a simple network
``phonebook.''  In our examples, a single server process will maintain one or
more phonebooks, with each phonebook containing a set of name-and-number
entries.  Client processes will be able to connect to the server in order to
add, remove, or locate phonebook entries.  The complete phonebook application
will be implemented in three different ways: first as a CORBA C program, then
as a CORBA C++ program, and finally as an ONC~RPC (C) program.  By reading
through these examples, you will learn how to use Flick to develop your own
network applications.
