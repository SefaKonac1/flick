# We must tell TeX where to find the source files.
#
# We prepend directories to the user's `TEXINPUTS', rather than override the
# search path completely, because we may need the user's `TEXINPUTS' to find
# ``standard'' LaTeX add-on packages that may not be installed in the usual
# place on the user's system (e.g., `TeX4ht').  When reconstructing the search
# path, we `$(filter-out ...)' to avoid oddities from recursive `make's, and to
# just generally be clean.
#
# We completely override `BIBINPUTS', however, to ensure that we aren't picking
# up bibliography data from outside the Flick source tree.
