All Flick software outside of the `runtime' directory is distributed under the
terms of the GNU General Public License (GPL).  See the file `COPYING' in the
root directory of the Flick distribution for details.

In short, the Flick compiler tools are covered by the GPL, but the runtimes are
not.  This means that you may use Flick-generated code (stubs) and the provided
Flick runtimes in your own programs without causing your programs to be covered
by the GPL.  Use, copying, modification, and distribution of the Flick runtimes
are nevertheless subject to the terms stated in the license above.

Note that the `support' directory of the Flick distribution contains files that
are not part of Flick, but which may be required in order to use Flick on
certain platforms.  (Binary distributions of Flick may or may not include a
`support' directory, depending on whether any extra support files are required
for a particular platform.)  Files within `support' are distributed under
various licenses; see the `COPYRIGHT' file in the root directory of the Flick
distribution for details.
