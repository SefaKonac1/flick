 This is a simple example for the Flick Sun RPC -> Mach3 back end.

FILES:
=====

pw.x:     the declaration file that you will use as the input for "rpcgen".

pwcln.c:  the "glue" code for client.

pwsrv.c:  the "glue" code for server.


HOW TO RUN IT:
=============

To create the stubs, type 

	make stubs

be sure the flick executables are in your path, as in
	make stubs PATH=.....:$PATH

The compile the programs, type

	make progs

Requires VPATH.
After compilation, a server program "pwsrv" and a client program
"pwcln" are generated.

Now you can run "pwsrv" in background and type "pwcln userid", the
real name of that user will be printed out.

To get the original Sun version, type make -f Makefile.sun, the binaries
will be named pwsrv-sun pwcln-sun.

The -DRPCGEN flag was used for the specifics.

Files from ../support were used as well.
