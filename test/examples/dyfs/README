Example 2: The Yalnix Filesystem.

A test case for Flick.

For the original assignment and more background, see http://www.cs.utah.edu/~gback/ps/dyfs.ps.gz


yfs.x	has the IDL specs.

make -f Makefile.sun 	
	builds it using Sun RPC on a Solaris machine

make stubs PATH=...:$PATH 
	builds the stubs for Mach

make progs
	builds the programs

-DRPCGEN was used to tell the transport layer apart.

To run, create a "disk"
	ln -s /tmp/disk yaldisk
format it:
	yfsformat -f

Start the server:
	yfsserver

And run clients:
	yfstest
or
	tygrys
