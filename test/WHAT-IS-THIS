This directory is the root of test tree.  The structure of the test directory
tree is patterned after the stages of the Flick compiler.  There are separate
directories to hold the results of each front end, presentation generator, and
back end.  The output from each stage can be verified against known-good copies
of the output files.  Driver programs are compiled and linked separately.
There is a Makefile in the root of the testing tree that simplifies the testing
process, and a README file to explain everything.
