This directory contains the definitions of all of the ONC RPC IDL-specified
intermediate data formats formats used internally by Flick (AOI, MINT, CAST,
PRES_C, and META).  These formats are specified in ONC RPC IDL because Flick
needs to send these intermediate formats between separate programs, and Flick
does that by writing data to intermediate files.  Because the formats are
specified in IDL, we can use `rpcgen' to automatically create the code to read
and write Flick's intermediate data representations.

This directory also contains the header files for the libraries that manipulate
Flick's non-C/C++-specific intermediate representations (i.e., libaoi, libmint,
and libmeta).
